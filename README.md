# java-bank
In this project I have created a bank system using Java so I named it Java Bank. In this I have added some basic features such as
> Create account      
> Know about us
> Exit

After creating an account the user get the username and the password which he can use to login onto his account. After logging in the user has the following faetures:
1. Profile
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. Transfer
5. Check Balance
6. History
7. Logout

After logging out the same user can also login again to his account
